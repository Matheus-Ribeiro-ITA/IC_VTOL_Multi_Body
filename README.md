# IC_VTOL_ITA

This is a multi-body VTOL simulator on MATLAB, still in creation. It is divided on 
"Flight_Simulator" and "Trim_VTOL" folders. The "Flight_Simulator" folder is still in creation
but the codes are available for anyone who wants to look or improve. The "Trim_VTOL" folder is completed and
it calculates the trim states results for the transaction flight with minimum thrust required. Unfortunately, some dynamic
equation mathematical errors were found which affects both folders, a new formulation is been implemented
and will be available on the first release (v 1.0.0).

## Versioning 

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when an **ERROR** is fixed. 
- MINOR version when **new functionalities** are added in a backward-compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backward-compatible bug **fixes** are implemented or **Visual** enhancement is made in the code.
